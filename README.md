# MothiaBot

This is a Discord Bot written using Discord.js (subset of Node.js). It runs a variant of the game known by names such as “Mafia” and “Werewolf.” When I was younger, I misheard it as “Mothia,” and frankly, I thought vaguely defined giant moth-related things sounded way scarier than the mafia, so that’s how this bot got its name. 

The bot is currently in the multiplayer testing phase! There may still be bugs in it, but all known bugs that interfere with gameplay have been solved. Additional/useful features are still being added, but all the basic features necessary to run a game are there.

Please feel free to tell me about any bugs or design flaws or just general ways to improve my code! I’m relatively new to Discord.js, and I’m still cleaning up and refactoring parts of it as well, so it’s kind of wonky. Feature suggestions and game improvements are also welcome! 

PPlease note that the only version of the bot in this repository as of now is the version that’s in a single file, which is functional but very, very long, and it probably falls afoul of best practices in places because I’m still figuring out how to follow those in Discord.js. In the future, I’m planning to add the multi-file version where code is more neatly organized and more in line with best practices. 

I haven’t done a formal license yet, but if you want to use it for some reason, please feel free to use and excerpt the bot’s code so long as:
1. You are using it for non-commercial purposes
2. I am credited as the bot’s original author

I hope this is useful to someone!

Instructions on how to set up the bot are forthcoming.
